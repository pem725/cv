## A. Personal Statement

My research expertise is ideally suited for the topics in the current project. Over the past 25+ years, I have developed methodological expertise that spans missing data analysis, measurement development, program evaluation, and applied statistical methods. My book, *Missing Data: A Gentle Introduction* (Guilford Press, 2007), remains a foundational text used in graduate programs worldwide. Beyond methods, my content expertise includes purpose in life, curiosity, anxiety, depression, and health outcomes across diverse medical populations.

Of direct relevance to the current proposal, I have served as Co-Investigator on multiple NIH-funded grants examining psychological well-being and health outcomes. My collaboration with Dr. Todd Kashdan on the Koch Foundation grant "Distinguishing extraordinarily happy from psychologically flexible people" (2016-2021) demonstrated my ability to contribute meaningfully to multi-method, longitudinal research on optimal human functioning. I am skilled in multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, item response theory, and Bayesian methods—all essential for the proposed analyses.

My unique background combining engineering (B.S., Notre Dame), exercise science (M.S., Arizona), and clinical psychology (Ph.D., Arizona) provides an interdisciplinary perspective that strengthens research design and data interpretation. I am committed to rigorous methodology and transparent, reproducible science.

## C. Contributions to Science

1. **Missing Data Methodology.** I have made foundational contributions to the understanding and handling of missing data in psychological research. My book, *Missing Data: A Gentle Introduction*, provides researchers with practical tools for preventing and addressing missing data. Unlike most texts that focus solely on statistical remediation, my approach emphasizes study design and prevention. This work has been cited over 3,000 times and is used in graduate programs internationally.

   b. Figueredo, A.J., McKnight, P.E., McKnight, K.M., & Sidani, S. (2000). Multivariate modeling of missing data within and across assessment waves. *Addiction*, 95(Suppl 3), 361-380.

2. **Measurement and Calibration.** My research on the calibration of psychological measures has influenced how researchers think about the interpretability and meaningfulness of assessment scores. This work, conducted with Lee Sechrest, introduced the concept of calibration to psychotherapy outcome research and provided methods for linking abstract psychological constructs to real-world referents.

3. **Purpose in Life and Well-Being.** My collaborative research with Dr. Todd Kashdan has advanced understanding of purpose in life as a protective factor against psychological distress. We demonstrated that commitment to meaningful goals serves as an antidote to suffering in social anxiety disorder and predicts positive outcomes independent of happiness.

4. **Curiosity Measurement.** I contributed to the development and validation of multidimensional curiosity measures, including the Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale. This work has been applied to understanding curiosity in workplace settings and its role in well-being and performance across diverse populations and cultures.

   a. Kashdan, T.B., McKnight, P.E., Kelso, K., Craig, L., & Gross, M. (2025). Enhancing curiosity with a wise intervention to improve political conversations and relationships. *Scientific Reports*.
