## A. Personal Statement

My research expertise in psychological well-being, purpose in life, and quantitative methodology makes me ideally suited for the proposed project on well-being. Over the past 27 years, I have developed programmatic research examining how purpose and meaning contribute to psychological health and resilience across diverse populations.

My foundational work on purpose in life, including the highly-cited 2009 *Review of General Psychology* paper "Purpose in life as a system that creates and sustains health and well-being" (1,250+ citations), established a theoretical framework for understanding how commitment to meaningful goals protects against psychological distress and promotes flourishing. This work has influenced intervention development and clinical practice in positive psychology worldwide.

Beyond purpose, my research encompasses curiosity as a pathway to well-being, emotional differentiation, and the measurement of psychological constructs central to human flourishing. My collaboration with Dr. Todd Kashdan and colleagues across institutions has resulted in over 130 peer-reviewed publications on well-being, purpose, and related constructs, with my work cited over 17,000 times.

My methodological expertise—including my foundational text *Missing Data: A Gentle Introduction* (3,200+ citations)—ensures rigorous analysis of complex behavioral data using multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, item response theory, and Bayesian methods. My interdisciplinary background combining engineering, exercise science, and clinical psychology provides a unique perspective on well-being research.

## C. Contributions to Science

**1. Purpose in Life and Psychological Well-Being.** My most influential contribution to well-being science is establishing purpose in life as a fundamental system that creates and sustains health. This theoretical and empirical work demonstrated that commitment to meaningful goals serves as an antidote to suffering, particularly in clinical populations. Our research showed that purpose operates independently of hedonic happiness and provides unique protective benefits.

   a. McKnight, P.E. & Kashdan, T.B. (2009). Purpose in life as a system that creates and sustains health and well-being. *Review of General Psychology*, 13(3), 242-251. [1,250+ citations]

   b. Kashdan, T.B., Goodman, F.R., McKnight, P.E., Brown, B., & Rum, R. (2023). Purpose in life: A resolution on the definition, conceptual model, and optimal measurement. *American Psychologist*. [50+ citations]

**2. Curiosity and Flourishing.** My collaborative research on curiosity has advanced understanding of this trait as a pathway to well-being, learning, and meaningful engagement with life. We developed and validated multidimensional curiosity measures and demonstrated comprehensive benefits across work, relationships, and personal growth contexts.

   a. Kashdan, T.B., Stiksma, M.C., Disabato, D.D., McKnight, P.E., et al. (2018). The five-dimensional curiosity scale: Capturing the bandwidth of curiosity and identifying four unique subgroups of curious people. *Journal of Research in Personality*, 73, 130-149. [520+ citations]

   b. Kashdan, T.B., Goodman, F.R., Disabato, D.J., McKnight, P.E., et al. (2020). Curiosity has comprehensive benefits in the workplace. *Personality and Individual Differences*, 155, 109717. [195+ citations]

   d. Kashdan, T.B., McKnight, P.E., et al. (2025). Multiple dimensions of workplace curiosity: Evidence of generalizability in nine countries. *Personality and Individual Differences*. [in press]

**3. Emotional Processes and Well-Being.** My research on emotional processes has illuminated how individuals can transform negative experiences into adaptive outcomes. Work on emotion differentiation demonstrated that perceiving distinctions in negativity improves coping and well-being, while studies on positive emotions showed how everyday experiences like sexuality and laughter contribute to meaning and life satisfaction.

   a. Kashdan, T.B., Feldman-Barrett, L., & McKnight, P.E. (2015). Unpacking emotion differentiation: Transforming unpleasant experience by perceiving distinctions in negativity. *Current Directions in Psychological Science*, 24(1), 10-16. [450+ citations]

**4. Anxiety, Social Functioning, and Well-Being.** My programmatic research on social anxiety disorder has revealed important connections between anxiety symptoms, functional impairment, and well-being. This work demonstrated that anxiety and functional impairment are surprisingly weakly correlated, challenging assumptions about clinical assessment and highlighting the importance of measuring well-being outcomes directly.

**5. Rigorous Methodology for Well-Being Research.** My methodological contributions ensure that well-being research rests on sound scientific foundations. My book on missing data provides practical guidance for study design and analysis, while my work on measurement calibration addresses how to create interpretable, meaningful psychological assessments.
