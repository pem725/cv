## A. Personal Statement

My research expertise in measurement methodology, missing data analysis, and quantitative psychology is ideally suited for the proposed project. Over the past 27 years, I have developed methodological expertise that spans missing data analysis, measurement development, program evaluation, and applied statistical methods in health and psychology contexts.

My book, *Missing Data: A Gentle Introduction* (Guilford Press, 2007), with over 3,200 citations, remains a foundational text used in graduate programs worldwide. This work demonstrates my commitment to translating complex methodological concepts into accessible, practical guidance for applied researchers. Beyond methods, my content expertise includes purpose in life, curiosity, anxiety, depression, and health outcomes across diverse medical populations.

Of direct relevance to the current proposal, I have served as Co-Investigator on multiple NIH-funded grants examining psychological well-being and health outcomes. My collaboration with colleagues across institutions has resulted in over 130 peer-reviewed publications, with my work cited over 17,000 times. I am skilled in multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, item response theory, and Bayesian methods—all essential for rigorous analysis of complex behavioral data.

My unique background combining engineering (B.S., Notre Dame), exercise science (M.S., Arizona), and clinical psychology (Ph.D., Arizona) provides an interdisciplinary perspective that strengthens research design and data interpretation. I am committed to rigorous methodology and transparent, reproducible science.

## C. Contributions to Science

**1. Missing Data Methodology.** I have made foundational contributions to the understanding and handling of missing data in psychological and health research. My book provides researchers with practical tools for preventing and addressing missing data through study design rather than solely relying on statistical remediation.

   a. McKnight, P.E., McKnight, K.M., Sidani, S., & Figueredo, A.J. (2007). *Missing Data: A Gentle Introduction*. Guilford Press. [3,200+ citations]

   b. Figueredo, A.J., McKnight, P.E., McKnight, K.M., & Sidani, S. (2000). Multivariate modeling of missing data within and across assessment waves. *Addiction*, 95(Suppl 3), 361-380. [450+ citations]

**2. Measurement and Calibration.** My research on the calibration of psychological measures has influenced how researchers conceptualize the interpretability and meaningfulness of assessment scores. This work introduced calibration concepts to psychotherapy outcome research and provided methods for linking psychological constructs to real-world referents.

   a. Sechrest, L., McKnight, P., & McKnight, K. (1996). Calibration of measures for psychotherapy outcome studies. *American Psychologist*, 51(10), 1065-1071. [890+ citations]

**3. Purpose in Life and Well-Being.** My collaborative research has advanced understanding of purpose in life as a protective factor against psychological distress. We demonstrated that commitment to meaningful goals serves as an antidote to suffering in social anxiety disorder and predicts positive outcomes independent of hedonic happiness.

   a. McKnight, P.E., Kashdan, T.B., MacKay, A., Kelso, K., & Gross, M. (2025). Purpose and happiness: A comparison. *Journal of Positive Psychology*. [in press]

   b. Kashdan, T.B., & McKnight, P.E. (2013). Commitment to a purpose in life: An antidote to the suffering by individuals with social anxiety disorder. *Emotion*, 13, 1150-1159. [380+ citations]

**4. Curiosity Measurement and Workplace Applications.** I contributed to the development and validation of multidimensional curiosity measures, including the Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale. This work has been applied to understanding curiosity in workplace settings across multiple countries.

   a. Kashdan, T.B., McKnight, P.E., et al. (2025). Enhancing curiosity with a wise intervention to improve political conversations. *Scientific Reports*. [in press]

   b. Kashdan, T.B., Stiksma, M.C., Disabato, D., McKnight, P.E., et al. (2018). The five-dimensional curiosity scale. *Journal of Research in Personality*, 73, 130-149. [520+ citations]
